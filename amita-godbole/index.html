Founder of the Nritya Damini Bharatanatyam institute, she has performed at numerous national and international events like the Chinna Melam Festival and the Cuttack International Festival.  The passion with which she performs often leaves the audience awestruck. She has also received the Nritya Vibhushan for her art.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="spotag-conversation dark"><div class="container"><h2 class="center uppercase">In Conversation With Amita Godbole</h2><div class="row"><div class="col"><h3>When and how did your artistic journey start?</h3><p>My journey with Bharatanatyam started at a tender age of six with my guru A Soudamini Rao. And since then, dance class was almost like my second home. There were no timing restrictions in classes back then so I would love to spend as much time there as I could.</p></div><div class="col center"><img src="../assets/img/amita-godbole-3.png" alt="amita godbole"/></div></div></div></section><section class="spotag-conv1"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col left"><img src="../assets/img/amita-godbole-4.png" alt="amita godbole"/></div><div class="col"><h3>What inspired you to take up a particular artform?</h3><p>There were only two obvious choices for classical dance back in those days; Bharatanatyam and Kathak. Since, circular movements used to make me sick, I was naturally drawn to Bharatanatyam. Bharatanatyam being a form of Moving Yoga caught my attention.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="spotag-conv2 dark"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col"><h3>Share atleast one setback/challenge you faced during the journey.</h3><p>I would say that my journey has faced a few hurdles. I considered dance as a hobby during my initial training years. Post Arangetral (debut on-stage performance of a former student of Indian classical dance and music), I went to Mumbai for academic education and dance kind of took a back seat. A salaried job, marriage and starting a family further took me away from this art. After a gap of 15 years, I decided to make a career in dance. It was then that I had to take a few challenging measure towards it like regaining my stamina, establishing contacts, pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Bharatanatyam. But finally I walked the mile and my journey kick-started again.</p></div><div class="col right"><img src="../assets/img/amita-godbole-5.png" alt="amita godbole"/></div></div></div></section><section class="spotag-conv3"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col"><img src="../assets/img/amita-godbole-6.png" alt="amita godbole"/></div><div class="col"><h3>Do you have a role model or an artist who you look upto or someone who inspires you?</h3><p>My Bharatanatyam guru A Soudamini Rao would always be someone who inspires me the most. Her passion for this art, disciplined lifestyle, affection towards children, excellent choreography skills, adaptability to changing times, her energy at the age of 85 are a few aspects which truly inspire me as a dancer, teacher and above all as a person.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="spotag-conv4 dark"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col"><h3>When not performing or practising your art, what is the one thing you love to do?</h3><p>I like to hang out with friends either over a cup of coffee or trekking with them or playing badminton, etc.</p></div><div class="col right"><img src="../assets/img/amita-godbole-7.png" alt="amita godbole"/></div></div></div></section><section class="spotlight-cta center"><div class="container"><p class="bold">Are you an artist too?
