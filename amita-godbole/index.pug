              h3 When and how did your artistic journey start?
              p My journey with Bharatanatyam started at a tender age of six with my guru A Soudamini Rao. And since then, dance class was almost like my second home. There were no timing restrictions in classes back then so I would love to spend as much time there as I could.

              h3 What inspired you to take up a particular artform?
              p There were only two obvious choices for classical dance back in those days; Bharatanatyam and Kathak. Since, circular movements used to make me sick, I was naturally drawn to Bharatanatyam. Bharatanatyam being a form of Moving Yoga caught my attention.

              h3 Share atleast one setback/challenge you faced during the journey.
              p I would say that my journey has faced a few hurdles. I considered dance as a hobby during my initial training years. Post Arangetral (debut on-stage performance of a former student of Indian classical dance and music), I went to Mumbai for academic education and dance kind of took a back seat. A salaried job, marriage and starting a family further took me away from this art. After a gap of 15 years, I decided to make a career in dance. It was then that I had to take a few challenging measure towards it like regaining my stamina, establishing contacts, pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Bharatanatyam. But finally I walked the mile and my journey kick-started again.

              h3 Do you have a role model or an artist who you look upto or someone who inspires you?
              p My Bharatanatyam guru A Soudamini Rao would always be someone who inspires me the most. Her passion for this art, disciplined lifestyle, affection towards children, excellent choreography skills, adaptability to changing times, her energy at the age of 85 are a few aspects which truly inspire me as a dancer, teacher and above all as a person.
